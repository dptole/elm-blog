# Elm blog

A mini blog made using only [Elm 0.19.1][elm_0_19_1].

[Demo][demo].

This is meant to be a learning project in order to slowly shift from OP to FP, or at least learn more about it.

In my opinion Elm (FP) is way simpler (than OP), more elegant and more flexible when combining different modules or using their singular features/functions while still strickly sticking to the architecture.
