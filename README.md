Elm blog
========

A mini blog made using only [Elm 0.19.1][elm_0_19_1].

This is meant to be a learning project in order to slowly shift from OOP to FP, or at least learn more about it since, IMO, its way simpler, more elegant and less reliant upon mob mentality in order to display stability and robustness.

[elm_0_19_1]: https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/24d3a89469e75cf7aa579442ecaf5ddfdd192ab2/installers/linux/README.md
